There are 3 types of applying CSS to your HTML code
1) style tag - it will contain all the styles for our webpage(html document)
2) LINK tag - the link tag will allow us to link to a seperate css file
 - SYNTAX: <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

    - one id can be given to only 1 element i.e id is unique for every html tag
    - two elements cannot have same id

CSS UNITS
 - unit : it is used for measurement
 The basic unit that we use is pixel (px)
 classify the units in 2 types
 1)absolute : the size is always fixed, the unit used is pixel(px)
 1px=0.2mm
 font-size:2px(2*0.2 mm)=0.4mm

 2)relative : they are dependent units, eg: %,rem,vh,vw;
 height:40%; (that the height of the image will be 40% of it's parent)
 %: is calculated with respect to the parent
 vh: view height (height of your display screen)
     height:2vh; (2% of your screen height)
vw: view width (width of your screen)
    width:3vw (3% of your screen width)
rem: it is dependent on the html element
    font-size:1rem (1*font-size of html element)
    *1 rem is the default size 
    1rem =16px;
    ** the default font-size:16px;

** EVERY CHILD element DERIVES IT'S PROPERTY FROM IT'S ELEMENT

RESPONSIVENESS : approach of building websites that makes sure that our website works perfectly on different screen size.
